GPL Exception ======================================================================

Any FreeRTOS source code, whether modified or in it's original release form, 
or whether in whole or in part, can only be distributed by you under the terms of
the GNU General Public License plus this exception. An independent module is a 
module which is not derived from or based on FreeRTOS.

EXCEPTION TEXT:

Clause 1

Linking FreeRTOS statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined 
work based on FreeRTOS. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public 
License cover the whole combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holder of FreeRTOS gives you permission to link 
FreeRTOS with independent modules that communicate with FreeRTOS solely through the 
FreeRTOS API interface, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,
and to copy and distribute the resulting combined work under terms of your choice, provided that

Every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a written statement that details to 
the recipient the version of FreeRTOS used and an offer by yourself to provide the
 FreeRTOS source code should the recipient request it.

The combined work is not itself an RTOS, scheduler, kernel or related product.

The combined work is not itself a library intended for linking into other software applications.

Clause 2

FreeRTOS may not be used for any competitive or comparative purpose, including the
publication of any form of run time or compile time metric, without the express 
permission of Real Time Engineers Ltd. (this is the norm within the industry and 
is intended to ensure information accuracy).
