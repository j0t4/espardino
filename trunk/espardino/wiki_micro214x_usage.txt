1st) Edit your makefile to include the **"micro214x"** library at linking time.
You can modify the espardino base projects adding "-lmicro214x" to the MY_LIBS var.

<code c>
  # System libraries to be linked with: 
  # micro214x and lib math for floating point support
  
  MY_LIBS = -lmicro214x -lm
	
</code>
	
2nd) Include the "micro214x.h" headers in your application.

<code c>
  #include <micro214x.h>
</code>
